Thank you for providing the correct dimensions. You have a property that is 37.7 feet in length and 20 feet in width.

I'll create a prompt for a 3D realistic image of a one-floor house design that fits these dimensions.

**Prompt:**
"A 3D realistic design of a one-floor house with a length of 37.7 feet and a width of 20 feet. The house features a modern, compact layout suitable for a small family. The exterior has a clean, contemporary design with large windows to allow natural light to flood the interior. The facade is made of a combination of light-colored materials like stucco and wood accents, with a small front porch leading to the main entrance. The roof is a flat or slightly sloped design, and the house is surrounded by minimal landscaping with a small garden area in front. The interior layout includes a cozy living room, a compact kitchen, one to two bedrooms, and a bathroom. The design is efficient, maximizing space while providing comfort and style."

If you need any specific details added, such as the number of rooms or particular features, let me know!
